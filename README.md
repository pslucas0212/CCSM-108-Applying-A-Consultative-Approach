## Why the consultative approach is important
Ask the customer what they are trying to accomplish?  What's the business problem the customer is trying to address? Don't get into the technical details of the product.  There maybe other solution options if you understand the problem well.  You'll need to understand this to make a business case to your software development team.

## The Consultative Framework
Two Type of relationships you can have with the customer
- Vendor - they tell you what they need and you just do it.  Not going to lead to long term partnerships
- Trusted Advisor - customer considers you a partner.  They know you are there to help them to succeed.  More likely to follow your advice

### Consultative Framework
1. Understand the primary problem they are trying to address.  Get to the core of their problem to recommend the best option.
2. Recommend an appropriate set of solutions to solve it.  Provide more than one option if possible with the pros and cons
3. Try to solve the biggest problme, not the easiest.  One that has a lot of value.
4. Focus on 'selling' a solution, not a feature
5. Be conscious of the fact that someimes 'best practices' may not be applicable to your clients particular situation.  Cookie-cutter playbook solutions may not work for a particular client situation

## Implment the Consultative Approach
It practice everyday in every interaction to be consultative
Ask plenty of open ended questions

Open ended Questions Examples.  
1. Tell me what you are trying to accomplish?
2. Why is that important.  Why is that a priority
3. How are you doing that today.

Dig in and explore the problem.

- Consistently educate your sharing insights and takeaways. Examples from other customers or data you've picked up from industry events. This will help build credibility and adding extra value to the conversations.
- Focus on long-term success and always strive to understand the big picture

Two Techniques
1. Active Listening 
2. Storytelling

## Active Listening
You've got to be good at listening.  Customers are telling you things all the time.  They are a treasure-trove of information.  use it to help you make better decisions.  Active listening helps to improve mutual understanding.  It improves each persons understanding of what each is saying.  Without active listening they way your repsond with the 'best' answer, you probably will not give the best answer.  Don't think about your response until you've carefully listened to the customer

Structured for of listening Active listening focuses the listening on the customer.  THe listener repeats in the listener's own words what the speaker said.  THis helps to avoid misunderstandings.  Speaker is inclined to share more with active listening.  Willing to share more information.  This encourages sharing.

## Storytelling
- Timeing and other customer/clients having a similar problem...
- acknowledge and validate their concerns
- Summary of impact
- Give a readl datapoint if possible - grew revenue x%, saved y%,..

Three storytelling Tips
1. Understand your audience.  What's important to them
2. Provide what matters to them.
3. Connect emotionally
