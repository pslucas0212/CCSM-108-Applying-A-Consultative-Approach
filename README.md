## Why the consultative approach is important
Ask the customer what they are trying to accomplish?  What's the business problem the customer is trying to address? Don't get into the technical details of the product.  There maybe other solution options if you understand the problem well.  You'll need to understand this to make a business case to your software development team.

## The Consultative Framework
Two Type of relationships you can have with the customer
- Vendor - they tell you what they need and you just do it.  Not going to lead to long term partnerships
- Trusted Advisor - customer considers you a partner.  They know you are there to help them to succeed.  More likely to follow your advice

### Consultative Framework
1. Understand the primary problem they are trying to address.  Get to the core of their problem to recommend the best option.
2. Recommend an appropriate set of solutions to solve it.  Provide more than one option if possible with the pros and cons
3. Try to solve the biggest problme, not the easiest.  One that has a lot of value.
4. Focus on 'selling' a solution, not a feature
5. Be conscious of the fact that someimes 'best practices' may not be applicable to your clients particular situation.  Cookie-cutter playbook solutions may not work for a particular client situation
